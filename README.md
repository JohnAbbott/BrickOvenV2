# BrickOvenV2
A second version of the brick oven thermocouple reading. 

Version one attemped to use Virtuino or Blynk to display temperature values on my phone.  But, I could not get either of those to work cheaply.  This version uses an Arduino Uno R4 and its wifi to display the numbers as a web server.
